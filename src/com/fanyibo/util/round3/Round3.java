     * The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon
     * consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left
     * room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
     * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops
     * to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
     * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these
     * rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive
     * integers).
     * In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in
     * each step.
     * Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
     * For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the
     * optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
     * -2 (7)	 -3 (7)   3(4)
     * -5 (19)	 -10(15)  1(5)
     * 10 (14)	  30(24) -5(6)
     * Notes:
     * The knight's health has no upper bound.
     * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where
     * the princess is imprisoned.
